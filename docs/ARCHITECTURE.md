# Architecture

How `SCUS_945.70` and its code overlays are laid out and how this repository
rebuilds them. The evidence behind each boundary is kept as comments next to it
in `configs/USA/main.yaml` and `configs/USA/overlays/*.yaml`.

## Disc

| File | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `SYSTEM.CNF` | 69 B | boots `SCUS_945.70` |
| `SCUS_945.70` | 422 KB | resident executable |
| `CRASHBSH/CRASHBSH.DAT` | 70 MB | data archive indexed by the exe; holds the engine module and 14 slot overlays (see Overlays) |
| `BASHY.` | 30 MB | unidentified (likely streamed audio/video) |
| `SPYRO3/SPYRO3.EXE`, `WAD.WAD`, `SPEECH.STR` | | Spyro: Year of the Dragon demo, out of scope |

## Executable memory map

PS-X EXE header at file offset `0x0`; the file body (offset `0x800`) loads at
`0x80010000`, `0x69000` bytes. Entry point `0x8002E7B0` (`__SN_ENTRY_POINT`).

| VRAM | File | Section | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x80010000..0x8002E7A8` | `0x800` | `.text` | game code, `src/main/main.c` |
| `0x8002E7A8..0x8004C56C` | `0x1EFA8` | `.text` | PsyQ 4.7: 254 Sony objects linked in place, plus `src/main/psyq/` |
| `0x8004C56C..0x8004CEFC` | `0x3CD6C` | `.rodata` | game (strings, jump tables) |
| `0x8004CEFC..0x8004DCBC` | `0x3D6FC` | `.rodata` | PsyQ, per object (`.rdata` of the linked objects) |
| `0x8004DCBC..0x80079000` | `0x3E4BC` | `.data` | game and library data, still one blob |
| `0x80079000..` | | `.bss` | not yet measured |

The engine module loads at `0x80078C90`, over the last `0x370` bytes of the
exe's `.data` (zeros in the file).

How the boundaries were found:

- **Library start** `0x8002E7A8` (`__main`, 2MBYTE.OBJ): lowest address matched
  by the PsyQ signatures; no function above it calls below it (0 calls), the
  game calls into it 285 times.
- **`.rodata` start** `0x8004C56C`: the end of `.text`. **Game/library seam**
  `0x8004CEFC`: the unreferenced `$Id: sys.c` string of LIBGPU; the highest
  game reference is `0x8004CEEC`, the lowest library one `0x8004CF34`.
- **`.data` start** `0x8004DCBC`: the first game table (pointers to the game's
  own strings) after the last LIBMCRD string; the lowest stored-to address is
  `0x8004E0B4`.

## Overlays

`CRASHBSH.DAT` has no header; the exe indexes it with a table of
`{u32 sector, u32 size}` pairs at `0x8004E110` (993 entries, each sector =
previous + ceil(size / 2048)). Scanning every entry (and the whole file) for MIPS
code finds 15 code files; nothing else on the disc holds code.

| Overlay | DAT entry | Sector | Size | Loads at | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `engine` | `0x3DF` | `0x8AEB` | `0x5E4B8` | `0x80078C90` | engine module, then the reserved slot image |
| `ovl5d`..`ovl6a` | `0x1E7`, `0x2CC`..`0x2D8` | | `0x6CD8`..`0x23690` | `0x800B32B4` | slot overlays, one at a time |

- **Load addresses** from `jal` targets: at `0x80078C90` 308 of the engine's
  internal calls land on prologues (next best 150); every slot overlay's calls
  into itself fit `0x800B32B4`. The engine's own `.data` stores
  `0x800B32B4`, and its header word 4 (`0x800D7144`) is the end of the slot image.
- **Engine layout**: 5 header words (4 entry pointers + image end), `.text`
  `0x80078CA4..0x80098594`, `.data`, `.rodata` (only switch jump tables,
  `0x800ADBD8..0x800AEC58`), a second writable block, then the slot image at
  `0x800B32B4` (file offset `0x3A624`): a stub with id `0x5C`, zeros, and from
  offset `0x54000` 40 KB of leftover build-machine memory (see below).
- **Slot overlays** are named by their first word, an id (`0x5D`..`0x6A`).
  Layout: `.rodata` (id, strings, jump tables), `.text`, `.data`.
- **Which game is which**: the engine's AST table at `0x80098720`
  (`{id, Init, Plot}` x 0xAE) points into the slot. Groups by id high byte:
  `0x13` -> `ovl5f`, `0x14` -> `ovl60` (Pogo), `0x15` -> `ovl61` (Arkenoid),
  `0x16` -> `ovl62` (Polar), `0x17` -> `ovl63`, `0x11`/`0x02` -> `ovl5d`,
  `0x12` -> `ovl5e`, `0x18`..`0x1D` -> `ovl64`..`ovl68` (`0x1B`, `0x1C` both
  `ovl67`), `0x1F` -> `ovl6a`. The Pogo/Arkenoid/Polar ids match the leaked
  enums (`POGO_AST_zero = 0x1400`, ...); `ovl5f` is probably Tank (its enum is
  cut off in the leak). Leaf functions reached only through this table are
  declared in `configs/USA/sym.<ovl>.txt` so splat splits them.
- **AST names**: the field order is fixed by the engine's spawn code
  (`func_80022DDC`): it stores `+4` at `nas+0x48` and calls it at once
  (Init), and it stores `+8` at `nas+0x4C` (Plot). Each Pogo, Arkenoid and
  Polar id is named from its leaked enum entry (id = `*_AST_zero` + position).
  The functions take the leak's own `Init`/`Plot` prototype spelling where one
  exists (`Init_PogoPickup`, `InitBall`), and `Init`/`Plot` + the enum name
  otherwise (`InitGravityObject`). Arkenoid spells four objects differently
  in its enum and its prototypes: `ArkFlash`/`_ArkCameraFlash`,
  `NGDeadWall`/`_NGArkDeadWall`, `LaserWall`/`_ArkLaserWall`,
  `ArkRepulse`/`_RepulseRing`. `AST_ArkDeadWall` and `AST_NGDeadWall` share
  one Plot (`Plot_ArkDeadWall`). Some of these objects live in the engine
  rather than the slot (`FloatyScore`, `ParticleEffect`, `ScriptFX`,
  `SmokePoof`, `WeatherNas`). Tank's pairs are not named: its enum is cut
  off, and the prototype order does not follow the table order (Pogo shows
  this), so its ids cannot be matched to names.

### Leaked source

A scan of every disc file for long printable runs with C keywords finds one
block: 40 KB of preprocessed headers in the engine's slot image (DAT offset
`0x45C9800`), from `c:\Crash4\GameEng\{Tank,Pogo,Arkenoid,Polar}\` and
`c:\Crash4\Core\Shell\include\alldbase.h`: about 400 prototypes, the AST
enums and the minigame structs. It does not define the engine's own types.
It stays on the disc (re-extract it with any strings tool); only names and types
derived from it are committed. No other source paths or `__FILE__` strings exist
in the exe or the overlays.

## PsyQ

Version 4.7 (signature scan: 262 objects, best of all versions; `$Id` strings
dated 1998). Sony's converted libraries (`ext/psyq47/lib/*.a`) contain the
objects the game was linked with: 254 of 255 identified objects are
byte-identical, and are linked in place of their code instead of being
decompiled. `configs/USA/psyq/`:

- `objects.txt` - every object found in the exe (address, size, LIB/OBJ).
- `layout.txt` - where each object's `.data`/`.bss`/`.rdata` sat, inferred from
  its relocations; the externals each object needs, at the exe's addresses.
- `sections.ld` - the objects' data sections pinned `NOLOAD` at their original
  addresses (the data blob still supplies the bytes).
- `symbols.ld` - symbols psylink placed differently from the objects' own
  layout; read last so they win.

The few library functions not covered by an object are in
`src/main/psyq/unknown/` (named by address) and `asm/main/psyq/2mbyte.s`
(Sony's hand-written `2MBYTE.OBJ`, not in the converted libraries).

## Build pipeline

```
src/**/*.c --cpp--> .i --cc1 2.8.1 -O2 -G0--> .s --maspsx (ASPSX 2.86)--> .s --as--> build/src/**/*.c.o
asm/**/*.s (hand-written, non-function asm) --as--> build/asm/**/*.s.o
ext/psyq47/lib/*.a --ar x + psyq_objs.py fix--> build/psyq/<lib>/<obj>.o
linkers/main.ld (splat) + configs/USA/psyq/sections.ld --> build/main.full.ld
ld --> build/main.elf --objcopy--> build/main.exe   == configs/USA/checksum.sha
```

Functions not yet decompiled stay in the C files as `INCLUDE_ASM(...)`, which
pulls `asm/nonmatchings/<seg>/<func>.s` into the compiled object, so the build
matches at every step. splat (`make split`) regenerates `asm/` and `linkers/`
from the retail executable; it never overwrites existing `src/` files.

Overlays (registered with `decomp.py add-overlay`) get their own
`configs/USA/overlays/<ovl>.yaml`, are cut from their archive to
`disc/<ovl>.bin`, link from `linkers/<ovl>.ld` into `build/<ovl>.bin` against
the executable's symbols, and are checked by the same `checksum.sha`.
